Patches are gladly accepted for bti code, please send them to
greg@kroah.com, or you can use github to send a pull request.

The code tree for bti is located at:
	http://github.com/gregkh/bti
and can be cloned using git from:
	git://github.com/gregkh/bti.git

If you have never used git before, there are some useful tutorials on
the github.com web site to help you through the learning process.

I am trying to follow the Linux kernel coding style with the code
wherever possible.  This style is documented in the Linux kernel source
tree in the file Documentation/CodingStyle.  Included in the bti code
tree is a script called checkpatch.pl that can automatically check if
your changes are compliant with the guidelines.

To test this, using git, generate a patch:
	git diff > my_patch
Then run checkpatch.pl against this patch:
	./scripts/checkpatch.pl --no-tree my_patch


Please run your modifications through valgrind if possible.  It is safe
to ignore the valgrind errors in the curl and ssl libraries, we can't do
anything about those at this time.
