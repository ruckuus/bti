bti - bash twitter/identi.ca ididocy

Allows you to pipe your bash input to twitter or identi.ca in an easy
and fast manner to annoy the whole world.

See the man page bti.1 for how to use it and more information.

Be careful if you use this, it is quite easy to end up sending sensitive
data to the world with it.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Any questions, contact Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com> or @gregkh
on twitter or identi.ca.

About OAuth configuration

If you want to use an OAuth-enabled service (like twitter), you should
configure bti to use the consumer key and secret shipped with the source
code (check the oath.keys file).

For example, you should add the following two lines to your ~/.bti
configuration file:

---8<-------------------
# Consumer key
consumer_key=cZy8DdioswAfu3LJYg6E2w

# Consumer secret
consumer_secret=fnIGGU0T12mMWKjmThUdSeKN32NLWfmnwapwubVQ
---8<-------------------

The next time that you run bti, you will be told to visit an URL that
will provide you a PIN number. You should then input that number in the
bti prompt, and you will be given two new configuration values
(access_token_secret and access_token_key) that you need to add to your
bti configuration file to authenticate requests from bti.
